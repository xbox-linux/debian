Welcome to the New XBox Debian Installer

This should be the new Debian installer for XBox.

For developing :

Install the included package debootstrap_0.1.17.25xbox_i386.deb
and the cramfs-1.1 tools.

The following scripts are important :

./unpack_initrds.sh	-> unpack the installer and
			   boot initrd

./make_iso.sh		-> build the installimage

./make_bootdisks.sh	-> creating the bootcd's for running from
			   hdd ( native ) or FATX

./build_basedebs.sh	-> building the basedebs.tar file.
			   Adjust the debian mirror you use in the script.

If someone made changes to the uncrompessed initrd's use the script 

./pack_initrds.sh	-> Creates updated initrd's

To be continued ...
